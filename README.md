# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio Homework 2

## User Story

```
AS AN employee
I WANT to show a potential employer my deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT the employer can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position
```

## How the Website Works

```
GIVEN I need to provide a sample to a potential employer my previous work
WHEN the employer loads my portfolio
THEN I present them with the my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN the employer clicks one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN the employer clicks on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications
WHEN the employer is presented with the my first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN the employer clicks on the images of the applications
THEN they are taken to that deployed application
WHEN the employer resizes the page or views the site on various screens and devices
THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
```
